     "description": "My ideas were sparked with a few portraits with non-conventional and ridiculous conditions which was a reflection of the teenage generation of Iranian women, which I enter to my paintings.Since the identity crisis of the new generation of Iranian women was and is one of my intellectual concerns, I addressed this issue in most of my paintings. The generation who is  between the limits and rules of everyday reality and fantasy in the free and joyful swing and the boundaries between beauty and obscenity has gradually changed to grotesque figures. As Stuart Hall said these people are in the process of being others. They see themselves as \u201Cother\u201D inferior of westerners. Their identity is made through the mirror of western media.\r\nContrary to what seems to be in appearance, they traditionally think and act in many ways. This feeling of inferiority comes from the obsession with hormonal activity and sexual repression.\r\nTo understand these behaviors, I became curious in their relationships to know how they act, what are their interests and their desire. Vanity, excess, artifice and extravagance .they are the first words that first come to our mind. Since extremes of exaggeration has become the character of this generation, I display it in a grotesque atmosphere and give it a painting exhibition called \u201Cshare me\u201D which lasted almost two years.\r\nOn the other hand, we see surrealistic shapes in some artworks which it also reflects the time and place I\u2019ve ever had and lived. Insist on loyalty to the elemental form as a unit and only element which the meaning of painting arise from it, is also a reflection of this situation.\r\nIn my point of view, the Iranian modern art target is war of ideas or community development. It\u2019s a conscious creativity, fact oriented, partially oriented which is used for guiding or proving ideas to others.On the other hand, artists facing the universal language of artistic self-expression with wide array and variety of different visual features and in the other hand they\u2019ve the traditional and native thus national visual heritages.\r\nAnd according to the times in which the artist lives, and s\/he\u2019s inner needs and demands would use some of these feasibilities and possibilities, but they also would give a personal and internal coordination to it. Hence the mission of my art is excepting to current situation, perhaps it become turbulence to my inner valve.\r\n",

     "description": " In this series she portraits her surroundings, inspired by a convoluted generation of young Iranians. Arkani's observations are critical yet celebratory, with a touch of humour that attracts the unfamiliar as well as the familiar.\r\nHer surrealist composition, trained technique, and vibrant palette, make for a rare invitation to peak into the soul of an expressive youth that is caught between a lingering tradition, a globalised world, and its own changing yet unpredictable future. This population, according to her, is running away from the weight of patriarchy with an urgency that at times goes astray and leads to cultural superficiality. \r\n\u00E2I think contemporary Iranian art is an introspective, realistic, and detailed creation which is used to guide or establish ideas for people and attract them,\" she says. \u00E2This is why my artistic mandate is about reflecting what goes around me, in hopes that it soothes the mayhem inside.\" \r\nShe sees the roots of such cultural anomalies in the Savafi era (16th-17th c.), when superstitious and religious beliefs were congealing in Iran. This is why she references the beautiful Golestan Palace as a backdrop in many of her works. \r\nArkani is aware of self-censorship and avoids it as much as possible, which is why having her work exhibited outside of Iran can be a relief. She has exhibited extensively in Iran as well as Europe and the U.S. This will be her first London exhibition. The Invisible Line is proud to represent this exciting, percipient and talented artist for years to come.\r\n\r\n",

     "description": "\r\nHaving had cultural and social issues occupying my mind all my life, I found \"painting\" to be a means to display them, and getting into \" pop art\" was my way of interpreting them into \"art\".\r\n\r\nMy first collection was about \" individuality \" , \" women\" , and \" cultural problems in society\". It was only later that I got to know Rumi and his works. He ( Rumi), shows his mastery in using everyday events to present and show his spiritual beliefs .\r\nSome have gone as far as calling his \"Masnavi\" a \" holly book\", but I see this poetry book as the ultimate answer to solving social and cultural problems.\r\n\r\nHaving always been interested in self analysis, Rumi's poetry opened a window for me, through which, I could incorporate these thoughts into my paintings.\r\nUp until now, at the mention of the meanings behind Rumi's poetry with regards to painting, one was faced with the literal and yet vague concept, which only portrayed the emotions of the artist. While this approach and style is fully respected, it lacks the ability to fully engage and connect with the artist in order to enable him to envisage the true meaning of the poetry, and hence, the resulting art work fails to have any impact or leave any impression on society or culture.\r\nIt is indeed a difficult task to portray the true meaning of these verses in the form of art and in a simple and comprehensive format for the audience, and can only be achieved through \" pop art\" or \"surrealism\" . As I mentioned before, Rumi's poetry dwells on \" self understanding\" and \" joyful living\" and I , therefore, decided to incorporate them into my paintings.\r\n\r\nIn \" Masnavi\" Rumi compounds the everyday events with the spiritual world and bringing this fusion into painting can show the inner dimension of the artist's mind and soul, as well as the external aspect and the environment which involves social and cultural issues.\r\nThe fact is that in this times of no moral values, lies and deceits and all the corruptions that endangers the health of the society, with the confused \"man\" scurrying about in utter bewilderment , the message inscribed in Rumi's poetry can be a welcomed cool breeze on the stifled air of the society.\r\nThis inspired me to use varied concepts of Rumi's views about the understanding of oneself and the society, in my paintings.\r\n\r\nThe combination of the meaning in Rumi's verses and the images of the society take form in 12 oil color paintings on canvas. \"Carpet\" which is the symbol for \" life\" is the common motif in all the paintings.\r\nCarpet in Iranian culture presents the feelings and the emotions of the weaver, as well as his taste and artistry .Various motifs and symbols have been used in this collection , where each represent Rumi's insight and views on self-understanding.\r\n\r\nIn most portraits, the presence of a famous Western woman who's the in filtration of the western culture into the eastern society. Surreal spaces seen in these works, in my opinion, provides more room to the artist, for bigger imagination, enabling him to exhibit Rumi's imaginative and yet spiritual dimensions used in his poetry. Rumi also goes beyond the material world and treads into an obscure and vague, yet a truthful world, where he takes the mind and the soul with him.\r\n\r\n",

     "description": "The most important objective of this project is to have a wide observation around eastern mystical philosophers\u2019 lives like Rumi and Hallaj and go further than their poems and small aspects and emphasize on the whole perspective of their lives. They have chosen the poetry to explain their concerns about meaning of life and in this project Homa wanted to visualize their way. In another word, make their lives tangible. With epitomizing their thoughts as the visual artist she has expressed herdelf by paintings, performance and installation. As most of Rumi\u2019s poems were made unconsciously and since he had improvised his poems of the book \u201CMasnavi\u201D in the class and in front of the students for ten years, he let us think about the aspect that the audiences have their own interpretation about the artworks concepts. \r\nHow does a part of the world, leave the world! \r\n<p></p>How does wetness, leave water! \r\nDon\u2019t' try to put out fire by throwing on more fire! \r\nDon't wash a wound with blood! \r\nNo matter how fast you run, your shadow keeps up! \r\nSometimes it's in front! \r\nOnly full overhead sun diminishes your shadow. \r\nBut that shadow has been serving you! \r\nWhat hurts you blesses you! \r\nDarkness is your candle. \r\nYour boundaries are your quest. \r\nI could explain this but it will break the glass cover on your heart! And there's no fixing that! \r\nYou must have shadow and light source both. \r\nListen! And lay your head under the tree of awe. \r\nWhen from that tree feathers and wings sprout on you! Be quieter than a dove, don't even open your mouth for even a coo! \r\nJelal'uddin Rumi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
